2568,Tinkering Fundamentals: Motion and Mechanisms,Exploratorium,Intermediate,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/tinkering-motion-mechanisms,"The Tinkering Fundamentals course will offer educators and enthusiasts an opportunity to develop a practice of tinkering and making.  We see tinkering as a serious endeavor�one that is generalizable across content and especially good at interweaving disciplines in a way that leads to complex projects and individualized learning opportunities. Tinkering has recently been introduced into the educational field as a potential driver of creativity, excitement, and innovation in science learning. It is seen by many as an effective means to engage in exploring STEM concepts, practices and phenomena. Tinkering typically blends the high and low tech tools of science along with a strong aesthetic dimension that supports children�s (and adults�) self expression.  NB: This is a hands-on course, so you will need several tools and materials to do weekly activities. You are welcome to purchase only what you don't already have�or even better try to scrounge them from surplus stores! We have put together a list of recommended materials, which you can find here: http://bit.ly/motion-materials  For over a decade, the Exploratorium has been developing science-rich tinkering activities for both children and adults. We see tinkering as a fun yet serious endeavor�spanning many disciplines and content areas and fostering connections between art, science, and technology. Learners follow their own path to understanding by investigating tools and materials and exploring questions that interest them. This opens up a wide range of possible answers rather than any specific �right� one, particularly for teaching STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) subjects in the classroom. This course centers on activities related to Motion and Mechanisms, which offer a wealth of opportunities for thinking through making.  In this course, we won�t just show you how we develop tinkering activities; we�ll also delve into why. We�ll focus on three important aspects: activity design around specific materials, facilitation strategies, and environmental organization. We�ll also share some guiding principles and learning indicators we�ve developed that can help you integrate tinkering into your elementary and middle-school science program. Whether you�re new to making or a seasoned tinkerer, we hope this course will help you take the next step!  OUR APPROACH TO TEACHING  This is a hands-on workshop, not a lecture-based class. Participation is essential! We want everyone to be making and tinkering together: trying things out, asking questions, sharing ideas, and reflecting together as a community. This is a wonderful chance to tinker and learn alongside people from all over the world and from all walks of life, so don�t be shy!  PLEASE NOTE: We have put a great deal of effort towards creating a supportive space that encourages exploration. We�ll give you a few ways to get started; prompt you to share your own observations and experience as learners, designers, and facilitators; and hopefully spark interesting conversations and discoveries along the way. While it�s not a requirement, we encourage you to take this class with a friend or colleague, or meet with other people in your area: having support or doing activities with others will enhance your experience and help you stay engaged.  This project was funded by generous support from Overdeck Family Foundation and the National Science Foundation.",discipline  chaining  pedagogy  teaching  child  experience  funds  principle  augmented assignment  phenomenon personal-development personal-development

2460,"The Power of Machine Learning: Boost Business, Accumulate Clicks, Fight Fraud, and Deny Deadbeats",SAS,Intermediate,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-power-of-machine-learning,"It's the age of machine learning. Companies are seizing upon the power of this technology to combat risk, boost sales, cut costs, block fraud, streamline manufacturing, conquer spam, toughen crime fighting, and win elections.  Want to tap that potential? It�s best to start with a holistic, business-oriented course on machine learning � no matter whether you�re more on the tech or the business side. After all, successfully deploying machine learning relies on savvy business leadership just as much as it relies on technical skill. And for that reason, data scientists aren't the only ones who need to learn the fundamentals. Executives, decision makers, and line of business managers must also ramp up on how machine learning works and how it delivers business value.  And the reverse is true as well: Techies need to look beyond the number crunching itself and become deeply familiar with the business demands of machine learning. This way, both sides speak the same language and can collaborate effectively.  This course will prepare you to participate in the deployment of machine learning � whether you'll do so in the role of enterprise leader or quant. In order to serve both types, this course goes further than typical machine learning courses, which cover only the technical foundations and core quantitative techniques. This curriculum uniquely integrates both sides � both the business and tech know-how � that are essential for deploying machine learning. It covers:  � How launching machine learning � aka predictive analytics � improves marketing, financial services, fraud detection, and many other business operations  � A concrete yet accessible guide to predictive modeling methods, delving most deeply into decision trees  � Reporting on the predictive performance of machine learning and the profit it generates  � What your data needs to look like before applying machine learning  � Avoiding the hype and false promises of �artificial intelligence�  � The social justice concerns, such as when predictive models blatantly discriminate by protected class  NO HANDS-ON AND NO HEAVY MATH. This concentrated entry-level program is totally accessible to business leaders � and yet totally vital to data scientists who want to secure their business relevance. It's for anyone who wishes to participate in the commercial deployment of machine learning, no matter whether you'll play a role on the business side or the technical side. This includes business professionals and decision makers of all kinds, such as executives, directors, line of business managers, and consultants � as well as data scientists.  BUT TECHNICAL LEARNERS SHOULD TAKE ANOTHER LOOK. Before jumping straight into the hands-on, as quants are inclined to do, consider one thing: This curriculum provides complementary know-how that all great techies also need to master. It contextualizes the core technology, guiding you on the end-to-end process required to successfully deploy a predictive model so that it delivers a business impact.  LIKE A UNIVERSITY COURSE. This course is also a good fit for college students, or for those planning for or currently enrolled in an MBA program. The breadth and depth of the overall three-course specialization is equivalent to one full-semester MBA or graduate-level course.  IN-DEPTH YET ACCESSIBLE. Brought to you by industry leader Eric Siegel � a winner of teaching awards when he was a professor at Columbia University � this curriculum stands out as one of the most thorough, engaging, and surprisingly accessible on the subject of machine learning.  VENDOR-NEUTRAL. This course includes illuminating software demos of machine learning in action using SAS products. However, the curriculum is vendor-neutral and universally-applicable. The contents and learning objectives apply, regardless of which machine learning software tools you end up choosing to work with.",Data Analysis  fuzzy logic  predictive analytics  Machine Learning  business case  analytics  natural language toolkit  .bit  software  Mathematics data-science machine-learning
